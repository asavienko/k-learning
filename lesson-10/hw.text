make("Write a function that takes a paragraph of text (i.e., a sequence of sentences, each ending in a period), and constructs a new (nonsense) sentence composed of the first word of each sentence, followed by a period. Do not worry about capitalization or periods within the sentence which do not end the sentence (e.g. Dr.). You can assume that all whitespace within the paragraph are spaces. For more information about the functions over strings required to implement such a function, refer to domains.md.")
